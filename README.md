# Website of the Scenoptica project

![Venice gull](https://scenoptica.com/images/jumbotron/venice-gull.jpg)

This is the [official website](https://scenoptica.com) of Scenoptica, an "open source filmmaking" project with the dual focus of producing thoughtful films, documentaries, lectures, essays, and discussions that also have their reusable source content released for further reuse. All videos are released under a Creative Commons license, usually CC BY (source content) or CC BY-SA (produced works).

I have to note, though, that the videos are not *fully* open source; things like interviews in documentaries, which might have private portions or interactions, may be not be released or are otherwise released in edited form, while video essays contain a lot of low-value takes that will take up more hard drive space than they're worth. This website, meanwhile, is naturally also open source, and can be forked in accordance with the [GPLv3 license](https://github.com/jaybaeta/scenoptica.com/blob/master/LICENSE).

In keeping with the spirit of the project, we also try to use and promote other open source projects that share our philosophy, including [Linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux) and [KDE](https://github.com/KDE), [Kdenlive](https://github.com/KDE/kdenlive), [Magic Lantern](https://magiclantern.fm/), [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm) (not truly free/libre but has very helpfully navigated us out of some disasters), and the [Internet Archive](https://github.com/internetarchive).

## Reporting bugs and contributing

**Reporting bugs:** If you find something wrong on the website, please open an issue and report it here. 

**Contributing:** Alternatively, if you can fix the error, we'd welcome a pull request! Performing all of the tasks of running a project is hard and every minute spent away from minutiae is one we can spend on more important things.

If you'd like to collaborate with us on something, we'd also love to hear from you. Hopefully we can work something out!

## Supporting the project

Scenoptica has no proprietary components. We thus rely on the support and contributions of viewers and reusers. If you want to keep us going, you can support us on these platforms:

Liberapay: https://liberapay.com/Scenoptica/donate  
Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/scenoptica  
Ko-fi: https://ko-fi.com/scenoptica

Alternative methods are possible. Please reach out to us if there's another way you could help. If you want to learn about where your support would go, we have a [description of these activities here](https://scenoptica.com/support-us.html).

Briefly, funds go to: upgrading equipment, paying people who help us with production, maintenance costs, supporting ourselves and about a dozen rescue cats, and finally, community mutual aid in the Yogyakarta (Indonesia) region.
